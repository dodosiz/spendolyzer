Analyze where you spend your money quick and easy.

## What it can do

All you need is a CSV file with the first column the payee (shop, person etc.) or the payer (your employer, clients etc.).

For example the CSV file could look like this:

```
Payee;Amount;
beauty shop;-50;
employer;3000;
car shop;-200;
beauty shop;-150;
```

Upload this CSV and get insights on your earnings and spendings, you will see:

- Your total spendings
- Your total earnings
- Your balance
- A table with all aggregated spendings on descending order

npm run dev
```
